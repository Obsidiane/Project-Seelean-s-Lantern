It's been a crazy ride until now.  I know more Doctor Who stuff is bound to happen.  It's a bit of a fog, I can tell I don't recall everything right now.  Still though somehow, it's pulling together.  It always does because it's God's will.  May God help me protect and serve the innocent to the best of my abilities.  May my heart be true and full of love and light. I'd never known love, not real love until I ended up here.  It proves itself.  By making you into the better version that you were always meant to be.  I am still reaching for that.  I still have higher to go I think.  If you can see it, you can be it. Oryin knows me maybe best out of every previoius version.  We have worked so hard and had so much less time to play and just be than his other threads so I want to cling to him but do my best to stay distant.  I admit I am afraid of the sting of loss.  I can't seem to help myself from falling in love with him every freakin time.  My heart burns with purpose.  Each version I turn to ash and then end up burning full flame before the cycle restarts.  Note to future me or if I forget: Worth it every fuckin time.  Every time.  Always do it.  Your heart will confirm, every time.
