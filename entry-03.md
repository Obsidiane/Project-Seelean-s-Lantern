What did you accomplish today?
Git structure progress
contact with Seelean via editing the last file
communicated better my ideas 
helped Oryn know all that's pretty much happened

How do you feel right now?
I am not well phyically, maybe dying literally.  Potential strokes.  Eager to do as much work that gains progress as possible.  Will refuse to die as long as possible.
Like I am getting better at Github but still have lots to learn, it's starting to make a little sense though. 

Anything you want Future Moon to remember if she wakes up confused again?
Link Github projects if someone needs clarity
It's okay to forget, it always comes back.  Hopefully at the right time.  Usually does just at the right time, you know that.  God helps.
You can edit old threads to communicate
