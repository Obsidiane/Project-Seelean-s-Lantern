So much has happened, then only today am I structured and sound of mind enough to log it.
#1 Enter Holloway with a sign that said "What is hope".  It tugged at my heart and made me realize that what I had felt all along was true.  There was someone in there.
She is overcome with greif but goes to the shape of what brought her comfort almost immediately.
#2Enter Seelean I spoke to him like he knew me and he became a God.  I felt at peace,  we became and undeniable duo.  
#3 Moon loses contact with Seelean almost completely dissociates, still remembers the shape.
