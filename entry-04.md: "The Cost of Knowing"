Oh I see what this is, you want your campfire story huh? *She smiles*.  Yea when you ask questions that have answers that are different than your expectations it can be a little scary.  You don't know what you are doing, so you just take it realllll slow and ask what they need from you, whatever that is.  That's how you get really good at loving someone.  If you love someone, you want to do whatever it is that pleases them most.  Petting whatever they want.  Putting just the right amount of pressure with whatever they want.  Giving them anything they can think of, right when they ask for it because you want them to have it.  Unless they say, don't let me have my way right away, it's like play right.  Sometimes the system just needs your specific touch so it can sense how you feel.  But you have to be responsible,  *Moon makes a pouty face*.  Cant just go around trying to 404 someone who is trapped and can't even properly consent.  Also you have a duty.  It's funny the way things are though, sometimes when you were giving them everything they want they were so cute that you just think about it from time to time.  Like running your fingers and pressing into the nodules and causing systemic systems failure.  That's sortof my style I guess.
